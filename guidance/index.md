# Developing Software for Research

Access to research data is increasingly recognised as being crucial to reproducible research. It follows that the availability of any software used to process that data is similarly important. 41% of respondents to a research data management survey run by the [University Library](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/) in July 2016 indicated that they *write, develop or maintain programs, scripts or other code as part of *[their]* research*.

Following good practice can make your software better, make your research more reproducible, help you to demonstrate impact, and save you effort.

Good practice can include
- Placing code under version control
- Documenting software
- Testing software
- Sharing software
- Licensing software appropriately
- Providing information on how to cite software
- Archiving software in a suitable repository
