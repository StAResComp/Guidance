# Guidance for RSEs at St Andrews

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sta-rse-guidance/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/sta-rse-guidance/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/sta-rse-guidance/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

As of November 2016, the University of St Andrews does not make available any online guidance or other resources to support the development of software for research. The purpose of this repository is to draft such materials.

Markdown files covering various topics are to be created in the [/](root directory). Resources, references and tools which might inform the guidance, which might be cited or to which we might direct users can be collected in [resources.md](resources.md).

Feel free to contribute via pull requests or issues. Please note that while we greatly appreciate any and all contributions and believe that this process will help us to create a resource of the greatest possible usefulness to [RSEs](http://www.rse.ac.uk/) at St Andrews, all guidance will need to be in line with the relevant University policies and guidance in related areas (e.g. Research Data Management).

Page drafts can be browsed at https://starescomp.github.io/Guidance/.
